For temperatures >0 && <=10, it may hail, but usually it will rain.
For temperatures >0 && <200, it will rain.
For temperatures >200, it's too hot to rain.
For temperatures <0 && > -274, it will snow.
For temperatures <= -274, it's less than absolute zero. Nothing can happen, nothing will happen.

Wind preferrably should be ~<|1000|, otherwise it does not look well.

If it snows, snow sticks and will be removed when it rains.

Updates:
No global variables.
Separated logically into classes and files.
Better readability.
